#Flask Blog for Indian Jaunt (Summer 2016)
My first Flask app! Done on own volition to ensure I had a beginner's
mastery of Python. Little did I know, it would require a lot more than just
Python!

Features:
-An I/O system the reads my blog post from text files and inserts them into
HTML. Also reads tags and post number from file. (Python/Flask/HTML)
-A search function to search posts via tags (to make similar posts 
searchable) and page numbers (to ensure blog posts appear in proper order). (Flask, Python, HTML) 
-A comment DB attached to each blog post so that readers can post their thoughts
and comments. (SQLite, Flask)
-A hidden login system so the adminstrator can login and delete or edit comments
via a user interface. (Python, SQLite, Flask)
-A map of India with clickable links to cities such as Chennai,
Hyderabad, etc. Upon clicking them, will take user to page containing
blog posts written in/about the cities. (CSS/HTML)

Utilizes Flask, Python, SQLite, HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of Javascript.
